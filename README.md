## Project Description:

Introducing **"Disney Chat"** – a chat room with a magical Disney theme! With **Disney Chat**, you can communicate with your friends in a delightful, Disney-inspired chat environment. Whether you want to chat, share your favorite Disney moments, or simply enjoy the enchanting atmosphere, this chat room is the perfect place to connect.

**Features:**

1. **Real-Time Chat:** **Disney Chat** offers real-time messaging, allowing you to chat instantly with friends, no matter where they are.
2. **Multi-User Support:** **Disney Chat** enables multiple users to engage in conversations simultaneously. Chat with one friend or join group discussions with many—it's all at your fingertips.
3. **Anonymous Chat:** If you prefer to remain anonymous, **Disney Chat** offers the option to use a unique nickname while chatting. Protect your privacy while enjoying the chat.

**Implementation Using Go Language:**

1. **Server Side:** The server side of **Disney Chat** can be developed using Go. You can create a Go program that listens for incoming connections and manages the chat room. This server will handle user authentication, message broadcasting, and managing the chat rooms.
2. **Client Side:** The client side can also be developed in Go, allowing users to connect to the server and interact with the chat room. Users can choose to chat with their own Disney-themed nickname and send Disney emojis to friends.

This approach offers a scalable and efficient solution for creating a Disney-themed chat room where users can engage in real-time conversations, express themselves with Disney emojis, chat anonymously, and interact with multiple users, all using the power and simplicity of the Go language
